# snowflake-domain-template - terraform

## Intent

- To manage the infrastructure of the Snowflake account that represents the domain

## Running Locally

### Setup

The terraform state is maintained in the main AWS datahub account. You therefore need both access to that account as well as the following `~/.aws/config` entry:

```
[profile data]
sso_session = Which?
sso_account_id = 094555056740
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
region = eu-west-1

[sso-session Which?]
sso_start_url = https://d-9367081d75.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = eu-west-1
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

To login:

```sh
aws sso login --profile data
```

Then prefix every `terragrunt` with:

```sh
aws2-wrap ---profile data
```

Ensure you are on the VPN or office network.

The following environment variables are used by this code:

- `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_ID` (required) - the ID of the account being managed
- `SNOWFLAKE_USER` (required) - the username to manage the account
- `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_REGION` (optional) - the AWS region of the account (default: `eu-west-1`)
- `SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY` (required) - the private key for the `CI_CD` user in your account (part of the [snowflake-datamesh](https://github.com/whichdigital/snowflake-datamesh?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) process)
- `W_GITHUB_TOKEN` (optional) - supports SSH repository authentication.  Please contact the Data Platform team for confirmation of which `value` to use. 

**NOTE:** `SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY` is **not** set against your repository, you'll need to do that yourself.

### Terraform Updates

Update the file `terragrunt.hcl`, section `default_tags` with the repository name

```
ManagedIn      = "https://github.com/whichdigital/REPLACE_VALUE"
```

### Process

```sh
terragrunt init
terragrunt plan
terragrunt apply
```
